Glad to see there are more developments in the Vesuvius challenge - it has been one of the most interesting things I&#x27;ve discovered on HN.,prashp,2024-12-02 05:17:19
"This project is a gem, I invite everybody to read their landing page, especially the page announcing the Grand Prize winner of last year, where they also quickly describe the project [1], and the Master Plan [2], where they talk about their goals.<p>As a recap:
- The real, narrative part of ancient Roman and Greek history comes from the tiny minority of texts survived by being copied through the centuries by medieval monks. We know a lot through archeology, epigraphy (engraved stones) etc., but the meat comes from the few ancient historians, philosopher, poets and so on we can read because medieval clerics thought them worthwile to preserve.
- An exception to this are papyri, ancient &quot;paper&quot;, on which they wrote both high literature and grocery lists. They were used all over the ancient world, but most of them survived only in Egypt and other dried areas, for obvious reasons. They represent the one direct link to the texts as they were written at the time, apart from engraved stones (which, though, tends to be mostly gravestones, with some laws and political stuff thown in). Unfortunately, the great majority of papyri are fragments, and most of them concern bureaucratic stuff like receipts, contracts and the like, with sometimes a private letter or half a page from a literary work. Precious for historians, but not the kind of thing that changes our knowledge of history.
- But here it comes the Villa dei Papiri in Herculaneum, the town that shared the fate of Pompeii and was covered by vulcanic ashed from the Vesuvius&#x27; eruption of 79 A.D. The Villa was the home of a Greek philosopher, and there people found, at the end of the 18th century, 300 carbonized scrolls from the studio of the guy. These scrolls represent an absolute rarity: hundreds of complete works, most likely never met before, from the haydays of the Roman Empire. They&#x27;re probably mostly philosophical books in Greek, but they could also contain lost plays, unknown great poets or histories about periods which have few or no sources about (we know that there were whole histories of the career of Alexander the Great that are now lost, we have dozen-of-years-wide holes in our knowledge of most of classical history etc.),
- Unfortunately, these 300 scrolls are just lumps of coal. They&#x27;ve been cooked by the volcano&#x27;s ashes and fused shut. Any attempt to open them in the past caused the destruction of most of the scroll, and for hundred of years they&#x27;ve been considered lost.
- Until today! A breakthrough in CT scanning technology (brought by one of the founding teams of this project) has made possible to scan this kind of ancient scrolls with X-rays, accessing the internal &quot;pages&quot; without destroying them.
- Having a scan of the internal volume of the scrolls was all well and good, but still you couldn&#x27;t read anything! The scan doesn&#x27;t pick up the ink, and it wasn&#x27;t at all sure that there was a way to do it. That was the objective of last year challenge, gathering a community of competitors and mates to use computer vision and machine learning to virtually unwrap the scan and detect the ink inside, using AI&#x27;s ability at finding patterns invisible to the human eye.
- In only 8-9 months last years challenge was completed successfully, earning the winning team a big prize (almost a million, if I remember correctly?). We were able to read some pages from inside a sample scroll, showing forever that the task is possible!
- The goal of 2024 was to expand this PoC to read 5 whole scrolls and to improve the scanning process. At the moment we don&#x27;t know if the model developed for the Grand Prize of last year can be applied to the text of other scrolls, and anyway the whole scanning-and-virtual-unwrapping thing is incredibly time consuming and expensive and requires extensive optimization. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s been any major breakthrough till now, but of course many teams could be waiting the end of the year deadline to publish, since it&#x27;s still a competition with money involved.
- If the project is successful, the long term gains could be astounding. It&#x27;s not only the 300 scrolls we already possess, but the possibility that a whole library could exist, yet to be excavated, in the still buried part of the Villa. You have to consider that its owner was a rich magnate hosting Greek philosophers for the heck of it. It&#x27;s probable that he owned a big library, far bigger than the comparatively small one found in the studio of the philosopher. If we can develop a method to reliably read carbonized scrolls, the political impetus to dig the rest of the site would be difficult to resist. I&#x27;m Italian, I&#x27;d personally go in Rome to protest against the government if they didn&#x27;t allow it :D
- Finding this hypotetical library would be like finding a mini Library of Alexandria, a revolution in our knowledge of the ancient world. If you&#x27;re even just a little bit interested in this kind of stuff, this is the Holy Grail!<p>As a programmer (boring CRUD stuff) with a master&#x27;s degree in ancient history (but I&#x27;ve forgotten most of my Greek and Latin), this project tickles both side of my life, my old academic aspirations and my current career. Unfortunately I&#x27;m not advanced enough in any of them to really contribute, since the tech part is super-advanced CV and ML stuff I can&#x27;t even pronounce and decifring papyri is a whole new ball game compared with the tame texts I was translating at university.
That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m trying to evangelize about it, to at least contribute a little to its success!<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scrollprize.org&#x2F;grandprize"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scrollprize.org&#x2F;grandprize</a>

"Low code initially works quite well until you hit the limits of the low-code framework. If you just need a throw-away proof of concept, or a personal utility, or the like, low-code solutions can be quite efficient.<p>However, implementing anything significant that&#x27;s expected to be extended and improved, particularly when there are users that request changes, improvements and new features, low-code &quot;is like climbing a tree in order to reach the moon&quot;. You&#x27;ll  will very quickly run out of tree and further progress becomes almost impossible.<p>To a lesser extent the same thing also occurs with web development frameworks, but the limits are less constraining and there are often mechanisms that allow you integrate your own code, that implements whatever it is that the framework doesn&#x27;t provide.<p>Low code, frameworks, and &quot;build it totally from scratch&quot;, can all be a valid solutions, but the right choice often depends on a bunch of specific  considerations (technology, user &amp; quality expectations, organizational capabilities &amp; constraints, etc.)<p>My recommendation is to keep an open mind about alternative technologies and approaches, and to pick solutions that are appropriate for the environment in which they will be developed, extended and operated.

"I thought part of the beauty of homoiconicity, which doesn&#x27;t seem to be mentioned here, is not just that it&#x27;s natural to interpret tokens as code, but that it&#x27;s possible to interpret <i>the code of the program that&#x27;s currently running</i> as tokens, and manipulate them as you would any other data in the program?",Karellen,2024-12-02 10:49:57

As the author notes, in order to be useful a definition must exclude something, and the &quot;bicameral&quot; distinction doesn&#x27;t seem to exclude anything; even Python eventually gets parsed into a tree. Conceptually splitting out &quot;parsing&quot; into &quot;tree validation&quot; and &quot;syntax validation&quot; is slightly interesting (although isn&#x27;t this now a <i>tricameral</i> system?), but in practice it just seems like a simple aid to constructing DSLs.<p><i>&gt; These advantages are offset by one drawback: some people just don’t like them.

"<i>Homoiconic</i> has a pretty clear definition. It was coined by someone in reference the property of a specific system, many decades ago. That system stored program definitions in the same form that the programmer entered them in (either just the original character-level text, or some tokenized version of it), allowing the definitions to be recalled at runtime and redefined. He turned &quot;same form&quot; into &quot;homoiconic&quot; with the help of Greek&#x2F;Latin. It&#x27;s all in the Wikipedia.<p>Line numbered BASIC is homoiconic: you can edit any line of code and continue the program.<p>POSIX shell lets functions be redefined. They can be listed with the <i>set</i> command executed without arguments, and copy-pasted.<p>In Common Lisp, there is a function called <i>ed</i>, support for which is implementation-defined. If support is available, it is supposed to bring up an editor of some kind to allow a function definition to be edited. That is squarely a homoiconic feature.<p>Without <i>ed</i> support or anything like it, the implementation does not retain definitions in a way that can be edited; i.e. is not homoiconic. Some Lisps compile everything entered into them; you cannot edit a <i>defun</i> because it has been turned into machine language.",kazinator,2024-12-02 04:39:23
"If I understand the gist of this article it goes like ...<p>1.

Parser then assigns &quot;meaning&quot; to the nodes and branches of the tree produced by Reader, by visiting them. &quot;Meaning&quot; basically means (!) what kind of calculation will be performed on some nodes of the tree.<p>4.

"It is not only Lisp. PostScript is also homoiconic; tokens have values like any other values (and procedures are just executable arrays (executing an array involves executing each element of that array in sequence), which can be manipulated like any other arrays). The {} block in PostScript is a single token that contains other tokens; the value of the token is an executable array whose elements are the values of the tokens that it contains.<p>Strings don&#x27;t make it &quot;homoiconic&quot; in the usual way, I think; so, JavaScript does not count.",zzo38computer,2024-12-02 06:45:13

If you remember how those old BASIC dialects worked, you basically decided the line numbers for each line by yourself.

Subroutines got line numbers in the 1000+ range so they didn&#x27;t interfere with your main program (example here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.c64-wiki.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;GOSUB"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.c64-wiki.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;GOSUB</a>).

"Amazing to see this alive and kicking in this day and age.<p>I grew up programming the 8-bit Atari and it was such a great time to experience. Information was scarce without internet, so magazines and word-of-mouth was so important. Once you collected enough information, you could pretty much hold a mental model of the entire machine in your head, and the only limitations were the number of cycles you had per second or the effort you were willing to put in. I firmly believe this is how I developed the mindset of stepping outside of the problem and readily looking for out-of-the-box solutions that pays dividends to this day.<p>Programming was a mix of BASIC and machine language routines (not even assembly as you hand-assembled to machine bytes) similar to how someone might use Python with C calls but at lower levels of both. Later on I tried compiled languages like Pascal but it ran like a dog, not tuned for the slow floppy or memory constraints of these machines. Getting a macro assembler was next-level, where you could write everything to be as fast or small as possible. Self-modifying code for wasn&#x27;t only common practice, it was quite necessary for performance.<p>Other great pastimes were reverse-engineering games and copy protection in an arms-race. Most were pretty simple and it was always exciting to see completely new techniques or super-complicated multi-pass self-modifying or otherwise obfuscated code.<p>The filesystem on the floppy disks were also easily understood with sector chaining and a free sector bitmap, so you could write low-level routines like undelete or a defragger. Modifying the floppy drive with custom sector sequencing and RPM tuning could improve timings to get higher throughput and finding that you can add SRAM to buffer an entire track really sped things up. The simplest and cheapest thing was to punch a hole in floppy disks and write to the other side (of a single-sided floppy).<p>Having this level of understanding made you believe that you could do pretty much anything and everything (just not always fast enough) and makes you program without boundaries except the hardware. Even then it was simple enough to modify parts of the hardware like ROMs or extend it with helpers plugged into the bus or PIO (parallel I&#x2F;O joystick) ports much like the GPIO on a Raspberry Pi.<p>The graphics system on the Atari was really something else, with &#x27;display lists&#x27; of data that defined memory addresses and display modes (character or raster) that could be defined for each (character or raster) row, along with color palette lookup tables that you could modify to change all the colors using those values. Even the serial SIO daisy chain on the Atari was the basis of what is now how USB enumeration and command&#x2F;reply works.<p>Shout-out to Bill Budge&#x27;s Pinball Construction Set (PCS) originally for the Apple ][ and also on Atari. Of course being a kid I mostly made video games and tools for making video games like sprite editors, character&#x2F;tileset editors, font editors, and level editors. PCS blew my mind and later got me into making programs that build applications, following the likes of Visual Basic (but running on OS&#x2F;2 PM).",karmakaze,2024-12-02 03:27:39
"Maybe this is a good place to ask a question regarding the hardware that is required to transfer code from and to your C64.

"This is a phony work in progress (I do not mean to disparage the author, just the work itself, or perhaps the YC submission). There&#x27;s no direction, it&#x27;s just &quot;let&#x27;s do it because ... ?&quot; Here is the authors&#x27; answer to &quot;Why Category theory?&quot;:<p>&gt;The answer lies in the abstraction and generalization capabilities provided by category theory. It allows us to see beyond the specifics of a particular programming language, problem, or system, revealing the underlying structures that are common across different domains<p>Rest assured you will not find much of that by reading category theory (CT). This type of studying of CT reminds me of Shaolin monks trying to fight boxers (hint: the boxer wins).<p>Another peculiar thing about these notes is that the author colored every CT diagram (and worse even, there is no logic to the color choices, it&#x27;s just randomized.)<p>CT is a nice subject as any other, and useful to those doing research. You don&#x27;t need it if you&#x27;re not doing specific math&#x2F;CS research that uses it. Anything that could be useful to you from CT can be explained in one afternoon over some coffee or beer. For example, the notion of universality could be useful to many programmers: the &quot;most general&quot; object of its kind, and how that is reflected in relation to other objects of its kind; a brief example would be that the &quot;free&quot; language of all strings in the letters A and B is universal amongst all languages of strings A, B with relations, (relations such as AAAB = A.)<p>Don&#x27;t enter turbulent waters if you&#x27;re not a swimmer! Maybe you can take a boat instead. For those who already know CT because of other motivations (in particular, because they&#x27;re mathematicians who have spent many years studying mathematics), the applications of CT to computer science can come somewhat naturally, but for others, it&#x27;s an uphill battle and a waste of time.",CarpaDorada,2024-12-02 04:35:02
"The section on &quot;Mapping Category to Programming&quot; seems to totally miss the point of how category theory is actually relevant in programming. Functors, applicatives, and monads are category theory concepts that are particularly useful in programming, but they aren&#x27;t even mentioned here.<p>Category theory is <i>way</i> more abstract than programming, so
the truth is that you don&#x27;t need to know what these concepts mean in category theory; just understand them as programming concepts to start with.  For example, monoids are ubiquitous in programming, but the category theory view of a monoid as a one-object category is too abstract to be helpful. Instead, it&#x27;s much more useful to just think of a monoid as a set equipped with an associative binary operation and an identity element. Then you can easily see that strings, list, and numbers (with their applicable operations) are all monoids.",munchler,2024-12-02 04:46:19
Isn&#x27;t CT much about higher-order parameterized type-signatures of a set of &quot;classes&quot; that can usefully work and be combined with each other?<p>Then instead of grokking the CT and its theorems as a whole it would seem to be useful to learn about such type-signatures among a set of collaborating (OOP-like) classes which are useful for many programming tasks?<p>In a sense categories then could be seen as formalization of &quot;Design Patterns&quot;?<p>Something like that?,galaxyLogic,2024-12-02 05:39:02

"If you have a compositional system, such as a programming language, you can use category theory to predict its behavior, in the same way that if you have a symmetric system, such as particles in a box, you can predict its behavior.

"I have actually found that I learned the most when working without people who could&#x2F;would help me, and have also seen this mirrored with others. You may think your current situation could stifle your growth, but I actually think it&#x27;s an amazing opportunity to grow much faster than most of your peers (the main downside being that you might be allowed to make mistakes that wouldn&#x27;t happen with the supervision of someone more experiened). You&#x27;re going to be forced to learn how everything works, make high-level decisions like planning projects and deciding what tools&#x2F;software vendors to use, and actually own the implementation&#x2F;outcome of those decisions (which will be excellent feedback) - even many senior developers never truly get to this point and by comparison you&#x27;re going to be building those skills very early in your career.<p>You probably do want to learn some of the basics and force yourself to adhere to them until you are experienced enough to know when to break the rules. Definitely use version control, look up typical styling&#x2F;formatting&#x2F;etc conventions for the languages and tools you&#x27;re using, probably write unit or at least integration tests, prefer to use libraries when possible for non-trivial problems that aren&#x27;t core to what you&#x27;re working on. If you want exposure to this I recommend joining a quality open source project&#x27;s developer discord&#x2F;slack&#x2F;whatever just to see how they do things. You could also maybe convince your boss to pay for consultants or for you to attend to conferences or whatever if you want individual feedback (if I were your boss, I&#x27;d see this as a good compromise - you get some level of senior supervision for $2k&#x2F;yr instead of $200k&#x2F;yr).<p>My number one advice is to NOT rely on LLMs for things that they&#x27;re not smart enough for, and to always make sure you actually understand what it&#x27;s doing any time it creates code for you. This is the number one issue I see inexperienced engineers making these days. ChatGPT is great for converting simple to moderately complex requirements into simple to moderately complex code under a certain size, but it&#x27;s NOT GOOD at giving reliable high level advice that is &quot;non-obvious&quot; and unlikely to be in its training data. So please do not rely on it too much to explain complicated things to you (unless that thing is very well documented on the internet, which you would have to verify by searching for it anyway) and don&#x27;t ask to eg tell you if your unit test is good. It can certainly save you a lot of time and is often right, but it&#x27;s also often wrong in ways that are very difficult to spot unless you know a lot about the subject, and eventually (if not already) you&#x27;ll need to advance to the point where it can&#x27;t help you with your problems.",weitendorf,2024-12-02 04:46:23

"I was in a similar situation right out of college, and it worked out for me in the end.

Don&#x27;t put too much weight on any single book&#x2F;comment&#x2F;blog post—they&#x27;ll almost all disagree with each other, and you&#x27;ll learn the most by comparing and contrasting <i>all</i> of the strong opinions rather than uncritically absorbing any given opinion.<p>* Be okay with using work time for professional development. Your employer hired someone they knew wasn&#x27;t experienced into a role that is typically filled by someone more senior. They need to be okay with you learning on the job, and if they&#x27;re not you need to go somewhere else.<p>What I wish I&#x27;d done but failed to do:<p>* Don&#x27;t get overly invested and burn out.

"I have experience running Kubernetes clusters on Hetzner dedicated servers, as well as working with a range of fully or highly managed services like Aurora, S3, and ECS Fargate.<p>From my experience, the cloud bill on Hetzner can sometimes be as low as 20% of an equivalent AWS bill. However, this cost advantage comes with significant trade-offs.<p>On Kubernetes with Hetzner, we managed a Ceph cluster using NVMe storage, MariaDB operators, Cilium for networking, and ArgoCD for deploying Helm charts. We had to handle Kubernetes cluster updates ourselves, which included facing a complete cluster failure at one point. We also encountered various bugs in both Kubernetes and Ceph, many of which were documented in GitHub issues and Ceph trackers. The list of tasks to manage and monitor was endless. Depending on the number of workloads and the overall complexity of the environment, maintaining such a setup can quickly become a full-time job for a DevOps team.<p>In contrast, using AWS or other major cloud providers allows for a more hands-off setup. With managed services, maintenance often requires significantly less effort, reducing the operational burden on your team.<p>In essence, with AWS, your DevOps workload is reduced by a significant factor, while on Hetzner, your cloud bill is significantly lower.<p>Determining which option is more cost-effective requires a thorough TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) analysis.

I can also believe that LLMs can only make small deviations from existing example solutions in creation of these novel solutions.<p>I hate that we&#x27;re using the term &quot;reasoning&quot; for this solution generation process. It&#x27;s a term coined by LLM companies to evoke an almost emotional response on how we talk about this technology.

"&gt; In the extreme
case, a language model answering reasoning questions may rely heavily on retrieval from parametric
knowledge influenced by a limited set of documents within its pretraining data. In this scenario, specific documents containing the information to be retrieved (i.e. the reasoning traces) contribute
significantly to the model’s output, while many other documents play a minimal role.<p>&gt; Conversely,
at the other end of the spectrum, the model may draw from a broad range of documents that are
more abstractly related to the question, with each document influencing many different questions
similarly, but contributing a relatively small amount to the final output. We propose generalisable
reasoning should look like the latter strategy.<p>Isn&#x27;t it much more impressive if a model can generalize from a single example?",andai,2024-12-02 06:28:43
This would explain the unexpected benefits of training on code.,ijk,2024-12-01 20:12:58
"&gt;On the one hand, LLMs demonstrate a general ability to solve problems. On the other hand, they show surprising reasoning gaps when compared to humans, casting doubt on the robustness of their generalisation strategies<p>surprised this gets voted up given the surprising amount of users on HN who think LLMs can&#x27;t reason at all and that the only way to characterize an LLM is through the lens of a next token predictor. Last time I was talking about LLM intelligence someone rudely told me to read up on how LLMs work and that we already know exactly how they work and they&#x27;re just token predictors.",ninetyninenine,2024-12-01 22:03:07

And they claim that a responding paper that did not attempt to do pretraining, should have been expected to be well below the state of the art in chip design.<p>Given how important reasoning is for chip design, and given how important pretraining is for driving reasoning in large language models, it is obvious that Google&#x27;s reasoning is very reasonable. If Google barely beats the state of the art while using pretraining, an attempt that doesn&#x27;t pretrain should be expected to be well below the current state of the art. And therefore that second attempt&#x27;s poor performance says nothing about whether Google&#x27;s results are plausible.",btilly,2024-12-01 22:47:39
that resonates - less facts and more reasoning training data. The most low hanging in terms of non synthetic data probably being mathematical proofs.

"To be honest, I think the biggest difficulty this game faces is that at this level of funding and this time amount of development time, I&#x27;m not sure you can actually make something that lives up to the hype. From what I&#x27;ve heard the stuff that&#x27;s implemented so far is pretty good, albeit buggy. And the team definitely has the skill to make something amazing.<p>But you don&#x27;t want decent or even good from a project that&#x27;s spent over 12 years in development with over $700 million of development costs. You want a genre defining masterpiece that puts pretty much everything else in the genre (or even industry) to shame.<p>I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;ll be possible to deliver that, at least to the degree you&#x27;d expect from a game this expensive. At a certain level of development time&#x2F;costs, expectations become so high that it&#x27;s almost impossible not to disappoint everyone with the finished product.

But I wish they would just sit down for a quarter and stabilize the thing. I like to joke that the elevators in the game are probably some of their most advanced tech, the punchline is that if you have played the game you know that most of the crashes and other weirdness involve elevators. but I am only half-joking. because the elevators really are connecting zones and instances in a cool seamless way.",somat,2024-12-02 10:23:34

"Hello Hacker News! We’re Nas and Huss, co-founders of steel.dev (<a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;steel.dev"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;steel.dev</a>). Steel is an open-source browser API for AI agents and apps. We make it easy for AI devs to build browser automation into their products without getting flagged as a bot or worrying about browser infra.<p>over the last year or so, we’ve built quite a few AI apps that interact with the web and noticed - a. it was magical when you could get an llm to use the web and it worked and b. our browser infra was the source of 80% of our development time. Maintaining our browser infrastructure became its own engineering challenge - keeping browser pools healthy, managing session states and cookies, rotating proxies, handling CAPTCHA solving, and ensuring clean process termination. We got really good at running browser infrastructure at scale, but maintaining it was still stealing time away from building our actual products. So we wanted to build the product we wish we had.<p>Steel allows you to run any automation logic on our hosted instances of chromium. When you start a dedicated browser session you get stealth, proxies, and captcha solving out of the box. We do this by exposing websocket and http endpoints so you can connect to these instances with puppeteer, playwright, selenium(in beta), or raw CDP commands if you’re built like that.<p>Behind the scenes, we host several browser instances and route incoming connection requests to one of these instances. Our core design principle was to allow for every session to have its own dedicated browser instance + resources (currently 2gb vram and 2gb vcpu) while still allowing for quick session creation&#x2F;connection times. Our first thought was to have separate nodes running in a Kubernetes cluster, but the cost of hosting warm browser instances would be expensive (which would be reflected in the pricing), and the boot times would be too slow to handle the scale that some customers required. We got around this by deploying our browser instance image on a firecracker VM, taking advantage of the lightning-fast boot times and ability to share a root FS.<p>Today, we’re open-sourcing the code for the steel browser instance, with plans to open-source the orchestration layer soon. With the open-source repo, you get backwards compatibility with our node&#x2F;python SDKs, a lighter version of our session viewer, and most of the features that come with Steel Cloud. You can run this locally to test Steel out at an individual session level or one-click deploy to render&#x2F;railway to run remotely.<p>We&#x27;re really happy we get to show this to you all, thank you for reading about it!

"...well <i>that</i> makes a lot more sense now. Flashing back to my undergrad biology class, I honestly never understood what was so important about the &quot;central dogma&quot; or why it was so important to spend so much time on. Now, reading its origin story, it is immediately apparent why it&#x27;s interesting and such an important feature of life to understand. (Tangent: anyone who complained about mRNA vaccines &quot;corrupting your DNA&quot; fell afoul of exactly what the central dogma is about.)<p>More broadly, it is fascinating to see how often this happens. So many ideas that are spread or taught in their &quot;modern form&quot; are trite or difficult or just disconnected. And then you see them in their original place, often in the original discoverer&#x27;s words... and it&#x27;s immediately obvious what they really mean and why they&#x27;re so important. (Another example: Einstein&#x27;s (special) theory of relativity. Read his original papers! They&#x27;re short and explain everything!)

Then &quot;a&#x2F;0&quot; * 0 = 0. Any member of the field satisfies this equation, because for every x we have x * 0 = 0. So, &quot;a&#x2F;0&quot; could be any member of the field.

"As is usual there is quite a bit of discussion here on copyright reform, which is mostly just suggestions to change the term of copyright.<p>I think it would be interesting to consider other reforms.<p>Note that copyright is not just a single right. It is a bundle of rights. In the US those are the copying right, the derivative work right, the distribution right, the performance right, the display right, and some others. The bundle of rights might be different in other jurisdictions but in most it is similar. In the rest of this comment I&#x27;ll only be consideringd US copyright.<p>First, I don&#x27;t see why all of those rights should all have the same term. I see no reason to believe that the optimal term for say the copying right and the optimal term for the derivative work right would be the same.<p>Second, how about adding more compulsory licenses? US copyright law already has some compulsory licenses (also called mechanical licenses), such as for cover songs. Briefly, a federal agency called the Copyright Royalty Board sets the terms and rates for these licenses, and anyone can obtain the license according to those rates and terms, regardless of whether or not the copyright owner wants to license the work to them.<p>For example suppose we made it so that the copying and distribution rights have a three phase lifetime instead of the current two phases (which are an exclusive phase tied to the author&#x27;s lifetime followed by public domain). The three phase lifetime could be (1) an exclusive phase of a fixed number of years, followed by (2) a compulsory license phase, followed by (3) public domain.<p>The derivative work right is the hard one. On the one hand a short term allows others to play in an author&#x27;s universe. I&#x27;ve seen some really good and really well written fan fiction that is not currently technically legal, especially crossover fan fiction that merges the story universes of different authors. Encouraging this would be good.<p>On the other hand some things would be ruined if they became public domain too quickly. I&#x27;m quite pleased that Bill Watterson still gets to decide who can make &quot;Calvin &amp; Hobbes&quot; derivative works. If copyright was only 14 or 21 years (terms people often suggest), I&#x27;ve no doubt that every character from &quot;Calvin &amp; Hobbes&quot; would have started appearing in ads as soon as the copyright expired.",tzs,2024-12-02 03:12:23

"The problem is that programming languages have <i>always</i> focused on the definition side of types, which is absolutely necessary and good, but the problem is that only limiting use by, e.g., &quot;protected, private, friend, internal, ...&quot; on class members, as well as the complicated ways we can limit inheritance, are barely useful.<p>We need a way to define how to &quot;use&quot; the types we define.

"I&#x27;ve been working on a introductory STATS book for the past couple of years and I totally understand where the OP is coming from.

The problem is z-tests, t-tests, ANOVA, have very limited use cases.

"From the end of TFA:<p>&gt;The book is not without its weak moments, although they are few. One in particular which I recall is the treatment of A&#x2F;B testing. Essential to any hypothesis testing is the matter of how to reduce the sampling mechanism to a simple probabilistic model, so that a quantitative test may be derived. The book emphasizes one such model: simple random sampling from a population, which then involves the standard probabilistic ideas of binomial and multinomial distributions, along with the normal approximation to these. Thus, one obtains the z-test.<p>&gt;In the context of randomized controlled experiments, where a set of subjects is randomly assigned to either a control or treatment group, the simple random sampling model is inapplicable. Nonetheless, when asking whether the treatment has an effect there is a suitable (two-sample) z-test. The mathematical ideas behind it are necessarily different from those of the previously mentioned z-test, because the sampling mechanism here is different, but the end result looks the same. Why this works out as it does is explained rather opaquely in the book, since the authors never developed the probabilistic tools necessary to make sense of it (here one would find at least a mention of hypergeometric distributions). Given the emphasis placed in the beginning of the book on the importance of randomized, controlled experiments in statistics, it feels like this topic is getting short-shrift.<p>Can anyone recommend good resources to fill this alleged gap?",maroonblazer,2024-12-01 15:25:58

"Most statistics classes are not taught to people who will be professional statisticians. I agree whole-heartedly with this:<p>&gt; The book by Freedman, Pisani, and Purves is the one I would have liked to teach from, and it was the book I drew upon the most in prepping my own lectures, as an antidote to the overwrought and confused style of my assigned text. The authors maintain the underlying attitude that statistics is a useful tool for understanding certain questions about the world, but in this way it augments human judgement, rather than supplanting it.

"&gt; It&#x27;s generally my view that from a bird&#x27;s eye view LSMs are simpler than on-disk Btrees, largely because they are more composable and a lot more of their data is immutable.<p>I dunno about this. On-disk B-trees <i>can</i> actually be pretty dang simple! Both conceptually and in implementation.<p>In concept, for an on-disk B-tree &quot;table&quot;, you&#x27;ve got:<p>1. one growable file, or a sequence of fixed-size split files, abstracted over into a &quot;vector of pages&quot; type that you can 1. find the base pointer of, 2. overwrite a full page of, or 3. extend;<p>2. a &quot;metapage&quot; type, that works like the world&#x27;s most trivial filesystem: it owns a &quot;freelist&quot; of page numbers, and keeps a pointer to the live root of the B-tree; and it embeds its own hash, and a version number.<p>3. a mechanism for discovering&#x2F;choosing the newest live+valid metapage, essentially making this trivial &quot;filesystem&quot; into a trivial &quot;journalling&quot; filesystem. (in e.g. LMDB, you just have two metapages in pages 0 and 1, that are alternately written to, sort of like double-buffering; on DB open, the newer of the two by version is chosen if it&#x27;s valid by hash; otherwise the older is used.)<p>4. a readers-writer lock (which doesn&#x27;t need to be persisted to disk, because the on-disk file is never in a volatile&#x2F;dirty state. You can just OS-advisory-lock the file — those locks disappear when the creator process dies, which <i>is</i> what you want here);<p>5. read-only transactions, that take a reader lock, discover the newest live metapage, dereference the B-tree root, and pass that pointer off to the user, letting them have at it, reading the B-tree arbitrarily as if it were an in-memory data structure;<p>6. read-write transactions, that take a writer lock, discover the newest live metapage, dereference the b-tree root, set up an in-memory dirtied pages map, and then let you read arbitrarily + write arbitrarily (with reads indirected through the dirtied-pages map, acting as an overlay);<p>7. Copy-on-Write updates to &quot;clean&quot; pages during rw txs, by cloning the clean page contents onto free[listed] pages, dirtying the clone with the update, and adding the dirty version of the page to the dirtied pages map, to overlay the original page;<p>8. a read-write tx commit op that &quot;propagates&quot; the changes from dirty pages, by Copy-on-Write rewriting the B-tree ancestors of the parent pages to point to the new dirty page numbers, until you derive a new B-tree root page — which you then create a new metapage for, <i>fsync the file</i>, and then write the metapage.<p>(Note that this last bit means that a read-write transaction will effectively implicitly &quot;roll back&quot; on crash&#x2F;power cut — the data is written <i>before</i> the &quot;journal entry&quot; for it, so if the &quot;journal&quot; doesn&#x27;t make it to disk, then the data updates — including the updated freelist — are &quot;lost&quot;. All a failed tx has done is update free pages.)<p>Sure, that&#x27;s eight things you need to implement. But none of them are <i>complicated</i> or <i>unintuitive</i>, the way that a &quot;lock free concurrent skiplist&quot; is. You could whiteboard any one of those abstractions above with a junior programmer, and they could probably figure out a basically-correct implementation just from the descriptions above.<p>And that means that the implementations of on-disk B-trees are usually pretty short-and-sweet.<p>LMDB, for example, is one C file (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;LMDB&#x2F;lmdb&#x2F;blob&#x2F;mdb.master&#x2F;libraries&#x2F;liblmdb&#x2F;mdb.c"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;LMDB&#x2F;lmdb&#x2F;blob&#x2F;mdb.master&#x2F;libraries&#x2F;liblm...</a>) with ~8k of actual code (according to <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;AlDanial&#x2F;cloc"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;AlDanial&#x2F;cloc</a>).<p>Postgres&#x27;s durable B-tree implementation (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;postgres&#x2F;postgres&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;src&#x2F;backend&#x2F;access&#x2F;nbtree"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;postgres&#x2F;postgres&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;src&#x2F;backend...</a>) is 22kloc, and ~10kloc of actual code.",derefr,2024-12-01 18:54:10

"Skiplist discussions that don&#x27;t talk about heap effects are probably incomplete.  The big limitation with skiplists for anything that isn&#x27;t a &quot;mostly-write-once&quot; workload (something that, it should be noted, doesn&#x27;t get much benefit from the atomic implementation discussed) is that the metadata record is <i>variable sized</i>, which does bad things to heap fragmentation and cache locality (two things you probably care deeply about if you&#x27;re going so far as to junk your AVL tree for a lockless data structure) and isn&#x27;t amenable to the slab-style optimizations used elsewhere.<p>I love skiplists for their simplicity, especially compared with the balanced trees against which they compete.  But the truth is they&#x27;re very one-trick-pony data structures and don&#x27;t bring lot to the table as a general choice.  Their home is pretty limited.",ajross,2024-12-01 15:12:52

"This also happened to myself and one or two colleagues when I was a barman. We&#x27;d start our shift cutting up limes and lemons for cocktails, and we developed weirdly sensitive skin and dermatitis on our wrists and between our fingers. Eventually a nurse I knew identified is as a very mild chemical burn that we were constantly giving ourselves.

After this happened the third time, I finally decided to tie cardboard pieces to my legs and feet. No scars were left, probably thanks to the immediate burning feel.<p>Another time, I used so-called anti-grease cleaner, which is an alkali just stronger than common soap. Usually it comes as dense liquid like &quot;Fairy&quot;, but that one was spray. I wondered why, and I saw it work better than the previous ones, but failed to add 2 + 2. The % of the alkali was higher, it was a lot more aggressive, that&#x27;s why it was enough in smaller quantities.<p>Washing a pan inside with a brush (I did put on protective glasses), I felt it stick to my finger, but bother washing it off. When I did, I was already feeling the skin and the flesh underneath burn, and they shrank noteably, exactly like after  you touch hot stove inside surfaces, or hot gas oven grill.

Before each trial, the instruction write or type appeared before one of the target words appeared, and the participants were given 25 s to either write by hand or type the word multiple times, separated by a space. EEG data were recorded only during the first 5 s of each trial. To prevent artifacts produced by head and eye movements caused by shifting gaze between the screen and the keyboard, typed words did not appear on the screen while the participant was typewriting.

But the fact that his schools put out a newsletter, the <i>Bolitín de la Escuela Moderna</i>, which would be the best primary source for learning about it, and is completely inaccessible online, is an example of the way information is still locked away. I read about John R. Coryell&#x27;s prosecution for obscenity for his six part serial published in Physical Culture beginning in 1906, <i>&quot;Wild Oats, or Growing to Manhood in a Civilized (?) Society&quot;</i>, and I find that I can&#x27;t read any issues of Physical Culture prior to 1910, because they&#x27;re not online (looks like obscenity convictions in 1906 are still effective in 2024!)

We have endless legal debates and court cases about having our own laws and court cases available to the public without a rent-seeking intermediary given a trust by corrupt politicians in the past. Everything could be preserved and made accessible at lower cost than a few Marvel movies, or two weeks of Ukraine adventure, yet we don&#x27;t do it. Where&#x27;s the campaign for that? Nah, better to whine about &quot;racist, sexist&quot; LLMs. That&#x27;s the opposite of preservation: our entire history is racist and sexist content. Wiping that clean is <i>Year Zero</i> talk.<p>Our governments prefer reality to be interpreted through intermediaries who will modify it for their sake, or in exchange for payment. Our institutions prefer to be the guardians of information rather than the spreaders of information.

"I have bought 3 Eufy cameras that were well reviewed and heavily advertised “no subscription fees, everything is local” as the main features.
The hardware itself is fine but the software is rubbish, pure and total waste of every byte used to run it. Not only does it not work half of the time when I try to view the footage or connect to the live feed, but it also often misses motion that it should not - I would often walk in from of my house during perfect weather day and it would just not record any motion. On top of that the mobile app’s primary purpose is to show you ads of Eufy cameras, and they are everywhere in the UI, constant; every other feature is secondary extra that developers spend minimal time in between adding ads. Between unreliability and ads it’s all just so incredibly annoying to use. When you complain about the ads they will turn it down a notch, but not fully, the official response is that “they needs ads to pay for the app”, which is incredibly dishonest - it’s just Eufy product ads - you buy a camera, install the app that is required to use it, and you’re bombarded with ads trying to upsell you more of what you just bought because you using their product costs them. So instead of a simple subscription fee you have adware product with dishonest and misleading messaging, and an app that takes half a gig of space so it can show you ads.<p>I also remember reporting a bug that there was a constant “new” badge next to their referral button in-app, despite me clicking on it and reading it (which I though it would make the “new” badge go away) - support kindly explained to me that they have new referral program every week, which is bonkers because the only thing that changes is the date.<p>I did look into alternatives but didn’t see anything I could easily trust more after Eufy, so I’m looking forward to the future where simple open source software will cover this part of market, because private companies so far seem to just give you crap for as my $$$ as they can extract.",prymitive,2024-12-01 20:20:10

"Having had cameras and a couple of breakin attempts for a while now my biggest must-have for these sort of things is:<p>- <i>reliable</i> human detection (not just motion)<p>- integration via some sort of API or MQTT etc.<p>This project appears to have no &quot;smarts&quot; in terms of human detection nor APIs which is a shame. Just pure motion detection on its own is ok, but you&#x27;re going to pick up all sorts of things that you don&#x27;t care about.<p>E.g. I have foxes that run around my garden all night. I don&#x27;t care about those. But the second a human steps into my garden and starts approaching the house in the night, <i>all</i> the perimeter floodlights are activated, in-house lights turn on, a fake-yet-loud barking dog MP3 starts playing and I get pushover notifications on my phone that won&#x27;t stop until I ACK them etc (to wake me up).<p>So far, from personal experience, the most reliable way to stop an attempted burglary in-progress is for lights to switch on from inside as they are attempting to force entry.",mattlondon,2024-12-01 08:52:23

"I was a fine dining chef for 17 years. If you were in San Francisco during the 90s, I might have cooked for you. A simple way to increase demand is to remove or change the least popular menu item every week or every month. This technique has been so successful for me I wouldn&#x27;t waste much time doing anything else. Once I made a Napoleon pastry for a desert special while at La Folie on Polk st. which sadly closed recently. I had extra pastry cream and made Paris-Brest because we never threw out food. One waitress sold Napoleon on every table and the other waitress sold nothing but Paris-Brest. The dishes were fundamentally the same so I made both anytime I did one or the other as a special because waitstaff for reasons not explained in the article will sell nothing but one and others the other. I made cheese dishes to sell before the desert and fruit soups in the summer. This is the mid 90s and we were tracking data. The chef pulled me aside and showed me the sales from the previous month because I sold 1.2 deserts per customer.<p>Nonetheless, for the last six years I cooked I was a private chef on a mega yacht. People ask me if the guests told me what they want to eat. I say never because I never asked what people want to eat. I cooked what I want to eat and then make enough for the guests and crew. It is the best menu strategy. In fine dining, the customers make decisions all day long and in the case of being a private yacht chef, the guests are making million and billion dollar decisions. The last thing they want to do is have to decide what to eat for dinner. The family I cooked for rarely ate off the boat. And when they did it was because I said something like, &quot;I hear there is a very good restaurant in St. Barts named ....,&quot; which was code for &quot;I want the night off.&quot;<p>I believe the reason one waitress would sell every last Paris-Brest and the other would sell every last Napoleon was because they told the guests in the restaurant what they wanted to eat for desert. They made the decision for the guests.",dataviz1000,2024-12-02 00:06:02
"One thing I&#x27;ve never understood about menu design is the use of &quot;market price&quot; for certain items like crab and lobster.<p>I understand that the prices of these items fluctuate due to various factors, but it discourages me from ordering them because I don&#x27;t want to 1. ask the price (when you&#x27;re with people you don&#x27;t know well it brings attention to you possibly spending more than they would on the meal, and can make you come across as a bit overly focused on price&#x2F;money - could be interpreted as rude or poor manners) 2. potentially say no based on the price and deal with related social vibes that might put off + come up with a backup on the menu 3. not ask for the price at all and be handed a surprisingly large bill. Some of the times I have asked, the waiter will have to physically leave to go check the price, which is also something I want to avoid.<p>You might say something like &quot;if you have to ask, you can&#x27;t afford it&quot; but I genuinely don&#x27;t mind, and can easily afford, paying $50-70 on good seafood when I&#x27;m in the mood for it. Crab and lobster are some of my favorite foods, and their market price often comes in around there. So in the course of my life restaurants have probably lost out on hundreds or maybe a couple thousand in sales because of &quot;market price&quot;. I&#x27;m not sure if this simply something most restarateurs are unaware of, it not being worth it to reprint menus or even put the market price on a blackboard somewhere, or some other psychological phenomenon I&#x27;m unaware of - maybe putting a larger price on the menu discourages most other people from ordering it or, makes other diners think the restaurant is &quot;too expensive&quot; even if not ordering it, or pisses diners off when they pay $X one week and come back and see it&#x27;s at $X+20.

As to why, they said the loop buffer was primarily a power optimization. It could help IPC in some cases, but the primary goal was to let Zen 4 shut off much of the frontend in small loops.

"I think Aristotle had the greatest mind of any human who ever lived.<p>The older I get the more I realize that there are a thousand true and intelligent things you can say about any topic. Magazines, journals, and libraries are full to the brim of intelligent people writing intelligent things. But an extremely minuscule portion of that huge mass is made of writing that gets right to the heart of the matter.<p>And Aristotle is the writer I&#x27;ve encountered the most who constantly gets right to the essence or core of what he&#x27;s discussing, moving past the trivialities and the unessential to illuminate deep truths in a logical way. It&#x27;s why a short essay like his Poetics--which in many ways is a limited work for the modern day because it deals wiih a very specific type of ancient literature--is still pored over by modern writers and screenwriters because of the deep dramatic truths it lays out.",ChocMontePy,2024-12-01 17:38:57

If you work on any significant, high exposure project, be prepared for unimaginable political f***ery.<p>It&#x27;s also one of the least meritocratic industries in existence because most big companies have monopolies and can afford to be extremely inefficient when it comes to software development. The bar is mediocre. You just need to rehearse your leetcode to pass the interview; beyond that, you just need to be very good in a tiny area. You will be so highly specialized in the minutiae of your role that basically you will be useless as a software developer. You better hope there exists an equivalent role in a different large company if you want to have any leverage at all in the market. Startups or any business which relies on efficiency and actual skills will not have any use for you...<p>Still, the biggest problem is just how easy it is for incompetent people to bullshit their way out of anything and the metrics that are used to measure performance are so objectively horrible that it would be better if no metrics existed.<p>I&#x27;ve been in this industry for over 15 years.

I&#x27;m aware of code katas, but I bet close to 0 of the great programmers regularly spend hours a day just writing loops in C, just to REALLY make it second nature. Yet many great musicians do just that, except with exercises. I&#x27;ve spent months or years straight practicing an extremely easy to understand, but hard to execute riff. The dexterity and muscle memory needed for certain musical patterns on an instrument like guitar or piano can take many, many hours to develop.<p>I just don&#x27;t know of anything even remotely similar to this in programming. Learning how to type fast is the closest analogy I can think of, but being good at typing is almost entirely unrelated to being a good programmer. It would be like a pianist not being able to play chords, yet still being considered a (technically) good pianist.<p>---<p>If one develops a good technical understanding of their programming language, and reads a lot of code, they could produce some quite good code in that language on their first try.

"My main concern with application-defined schemas is that this schema is validated by the wrong system. The database is the authority on what the schema is; all other layers in your application make assumptions based on effectively hearsay.<p>The closest we came so far to bridging this gap in strictly typed language like Rust is SQLx, which creates a struct based on the database types returned by a query. This is validated at compile time  against a database, which is good, but of course there is no guarantee that the production database will have the same types. Easiest mistake to make is to design a query against your local Postgres v15 and hit a runtime error in production running Postgres v12, e.g. a function like gen_ramdom_uuid() doesn&#x27;t exist. Another is to assume a migration in production was actually executed.<p>In duck-typed languages like Ruby, the application objects are directly created from the database at runtime. They are as accurate as possible, since the schema is directly read at application startup. Then of course you see developers do something like:<p><pre><code>    if respond_to?(:column_x)
        # do something with column_x
    end
</code></pre>
To summarize, I think application-defined schemas provide a false sense of security and add another layer of work for the engineer.",levkk,2024-11-30 18:43:31
"&gt;My opinion is that SQL should be for computers to write. This would put it firmly in the same category as LLVM IR.<p>This is nuts.<p>SQL is a high level language. It&#x27;s higher level than python or rust. It&#x27;s basically a declarative statement that&#x27;s almost english-like and it&#x27;s specifically DESIGNED to be more readable and easier to use by humans. It compiles down into many procedures that don&#x27;t easily map to the SQL statement itself. You can&#x27;t get any higher level than SQL.<p>The issue here is that the database exists at the bottleneck of web dev. It&#x27;s where state mutation happens and it&#x27;s essentially usually the slowest part of the pipeline in a computer. Yet instead of having fine grained low level control over this part of the pipeline, we have a high level language on top of it. So if we want to optimize this part of the pipeline we have to HACK the query. We have to make the abstraction layer leaky in the API itself with EXPLAIN. We can&#x27;t do direct optimizations because SQL is so high level. It is a bit of a problem but the industry is so entrenched in SQL that it&#x27;s actually 10x more efficient to just use it then to develop an API that&#x27;s more appropriate for this level. SQL is tech debt we are sort of stuck with. The ideal API would be one that is both high level but allows fine grained control... but we don&#x27;t have one yet.<p>To use machine learning analogies. SQL is a local optima. There&#x27;s a much more optimal language somewhere in this space but we are stuck in the local optima and it&#x27;s likely we will never end up finding the actual optimal api.<p>In short SQL is the furthest thing from LLVM IR. It&#x27;s crazy. You cannot treat it as the same thing. If you do there are huge problems.<p>The problem with rust query and the problem with ORMs in general is that the API for these libraries are in itself high level. They are HIGH level abstractions ON TOP of high level abstractions. You want to optimize a query now? Well you need to hack the first high level abstraction in such a way that it hacks the second high level abstraction such that it produces optimized compiled procedures. That&#x27;s the problem here.<p>All this ORM stuff is just programmer OCD. We don&#x27;t want to do meta programming where we have another language living as a string in our web app. We want everything fully integrated so we create an abstraction in attempt to get rid of an abstraction that was intended to be an abstraction in itself.

"SQL, while not great, does have some advantages that are hard to beat:<p>- Everyone knows at least some basic SQL, even non-technical users have often encountered it in some form.<p>- The documentation for eg. PostgreSQL is for SQL, so if you write queries in anything else you have to mentally translate back and forth, and so you need to know SQL anyway.<p>- Any external tools you use to interact with the database will use SQL.<p>- Changing the queries doesn&#x27;t require an expensive compilation step - `sqlx` gets the best of both worlds in this respect, in that it is able to type-check the parameters and rely on the database itself to validate the query, so you don&#x27;t end up with a ton of type-system shenanigans that increase compilation times.<p>Maybe for a brand new database, a better query language could win out, but having used sqlx I can&#x27;t imagine going back to a query-builder style interface for existing SQL databases.",Diggsey,2024-11-30 16:49:41

My approach was to try to replicate sql query structure directly with the query builders, rather than abstract away from sql, whereas this appears to aim for something that&#x27;s less similar to the original sql.  I don&#x27;t consider myself an sql expert and I&#x27;ve seen sql abstractions that aren&#x27;t able to replicate all functionality, but seeing the reddit debate with the diesel author this seems fairly thorough.<p>FWIW in `good-ormning` I was thinking of getting rid of the query builders&#x2F;my own query ast and having a macro that parses with `datafusion-sqlparser-rs` and checks that ast instead, but it&#x27;s a significant change.<p>FWIW I think SQL is awful too, so I&#x27;m really happy to see the support here and I hope rust-query takes off.",rendaw,2024-12-01 08:03:07

One aspect that feels very counter-intuitive&#x2F;unidiomatic is that, if I understand correctly, in your example there is no Schema enum. Usually this sort of macro does not erase the type defined, and I would find it extremely confusing that I cannot reference, say, Schema::User{..}. It would be clearer to me if this were defined inside of a macro_rules macro, more like lazy_static e.g.<p>```

Actually this is a sort of nightmare; a seemingly simple plan optimization would completely change the layout of the query so you&#x27;re going to have a decent chance to write a full query rewrite stage just for the sake of workaround for a specific query engine.

"This is close to something I&#x27;ve wanted to see for a long time: a language where relational models are first class citizens and the engine for data storage is abstracted away.<p>Tables, joins, etc. should all be representable within the language&#x27;s type system and standard libraries. Connectivity to a database should be handled by plugins&#x2F;implementations of storage engines. If no storage engine is used, the relational data just lives in RAM like any other variable, collection, etc.<p>It&#x27;s kind of the opposite of an ORM. An ORM tries to bolt a relational database into an OOP or other language model. This wraps the language around relational database concepts, fixing the impedance mismatch in the language rather than with a translation layer.<p>It also means one does not have to reinvent relational concepts (badly) in every application with a complex data model even if that application is <i>not</i> backed by a database.",api,2024-11-30 19:45:14

"I love hardware mysteries.<p>I mostly drive old 90s enthusiast cars, and I have had my fair share of undocumented switches.<p>The most surprising to date was in a Nissan Silvia, from 1989. Sometimes it wouldn&#x27;t crank off the key, given the solution chosen it must have been a wiring issue. Instead of fixing that wiring, the previous owner had directly wired power to the starter via a &quot;missle switch&quot; style switch, and instead of mounting it anywhere remotely useful, it was just spliced into the loom and sat on top of the rocker cover in the engine bay.<p>So if it wouldn&#x27;t start, I had to leave the key at &quot;on&quot;, hop out of the car, bump that switch and then it would start. Obviously standing in front of a manual car while starting it is the dumbest thing next to wiring your starter to a switch in the engine bay. Fortunately I never ran myself over.<p>Another one, I will keep short, a 97 Skyline would only light up ready to start 1&#x2F;4 times. Seemingly randomly, on key bump. Turns out the flash memory for the fuel map had corrupted, and depending on the temperature and a bit of randomness from the sensors, it would only hit a corrupted cell occasionally. It got worse and worse as more of the table corrupted, until it would only start say 1&#x2F;60 key bumps.<p>It was a dodgy power wire causing the corruption, and fixing that plus reflashing the tune fixed the issue.",ehnto,2024-11-30 07:22:25

"Apple grower here. I still don&#x27;t understand Honeycrisps. I&#x27;m on the younger side, so I haven&#x27;t seen that many years of Honeycrisp, but I feel I have never had a good one. My experience of Honeycrisp is that it is super crunchy, almost too much so, but completely devoid of flavor. To me, it&#x27;s like eating crunchy water.<p>As others have pointed out, this article doesn&#x27;t actually explain why (or even if) Honeycrisp has gotten worse. One thing I will add to this discussion, though I don&#x27;t know if it is true in the case of Honeycrisp, is that it is definitely not a matter of breeding (nor selective breeding, breeding for storage, etc): in order to produce more apple trees, Honeycrisps (or any other variety) aren&#x27;t bred, they are asexually propagated through grafting. That means all Honeycrisp trees are more-or-less genetically identical.<p>That said, just like any organism, as trees grow and produce new cells at the tips of branches, there is always a chance for a mutation. Sometimes these branch mutations (called &quot;sports&quot;) have visible genetic differences: stronger coloration, earlier ripening, or perhaps earlier storage (though this is harder to notice). This is how Red Delicious went from a wonderful apple to tasteless, mealy cardboard: sports were selected over time that prioritized storage and color over texture and flavor.<p>As an apple grower, I have had the opportunity to taste Honeycrisps straight off the tree, and to me, they taste just as flavorless as the ones I get from the store. I grow almost all heirloom varieties, and I can tell you there is one that for me is head-and-shoulders above the rest: Wickson Crab. If you are in California, I recommend marking your calendar for September to search this variety out at the farmers markets (or better, plant a tree yourself!). There are many other wonderful varieties that stand out from grocery store apples. In a pinch, I&#x27;ll get a Pink Lady from the store, as I find it&#x27;s the most flavorful of the commonly available apples, but I find they sit heavy in my stomach in a way that homegrown or farmer&#x27;s market apples don&#x27;t. I believe this is to do with the fact that apples available at the grocery store are picked early, before the starches have converted into sugars, so the higher starch content may be harder to digest.<p>Hint: any apple with an &quot;apple green&quot; undercoat is underripe; to pick a ripe apple, wait for that bright green to mellow out or change colors. For redder apples, it can be harder to see, but most apples have some green visible under the red (Pink Lady is again a great example of this). And yes, Granny Smith apples are so sour precisely because they are picked and sold underripe; a ripe Granny Smith is yellow and sweet.",dmitrig01,2024-11-30 18:50:03
Storage is the key culprit. One solution for that in the US is to buy New Zealand apples when it&#x27;s nowhere near apple season in the northern hemisphere. Crazy to ship apples half-way round the world but they are delicious. I mostly see Envy apples from NZ in California.<p>Garlic is another item ruined by long storage.

"TLDR: The Honeycrisp apple, developed by the University of Minnesota in the 1980s, was initially celebrated for its crisp texture and balanced flavor, quickly becoming a consumer favorite. However, its delicate nature and susceptibility to disorders like bitter pit made it challenging to cultivate, particularly in warmer regions such as Washington State, a major hub for apple production. Despite these challenges, growers planted Honeycrisp trees extensively to meet high demand, storing the apples for prolonged periods to ensure year-round availability. This mass production and extended storage compromised the apple’s quality, leading to an oversupply and reduced consumer satisfaction. Consequently, the Honeycrisp has become a commoditized apple, losing the exceptional qualities that once distinguished it.",quijoteuniv,2024-11-30 18:55:19

"One thing I never realized is that apple varieties can&#x27;t be grown from seeds.<p><i>&quot;This is because seedling apples are &#x27;extreme heterozygotes&#x27;. Rather than resembling their parents, seedlings are all different from each other and from their parents.&quot;</i> [1]<p><i>&quot;To propagate a cultivar [variety], material from the original tree (scion) is joined to a rootstock. The rootstock provides the roots for the new plant and the scion forms the top part of the new plant, which produces the fruit. The rootstock comes from another cultivar selected specifically for its ability to grow well in the soil and induce desirable growth habits of the scion (such as dwarfing).&quot;</i><p>&quot;<i>The scion is introduced to the rootstock by either grafting or budding. In grafting, a length of dormant wood from the original tree is notched into the rootstock. In budding, small buds are notched into the rootstock. Budding produces more trees from the same amount of wood than grafting.&quot;</i> [2]<p>So when you read &quot;cultivation&quot;, it&#x27;s not like breeding green beans or corn, where you can crossbreed plants and come up with a new type that will &quot;breed true&quot; and then you can make a bunch of seeds to distribute. Cultivation is basically growing a bunch of trees, finding the right combo, then creating a bunch of them<p>So commercial growers with orchards will buy trees from breeders who create that type of tree by managing the grafting&#x2F;budding process.<p>Apparently, though we don&#x27;t know when breeding started, it&#x27;s been going on for thousands of years.<p>Also, Johnny Appleseed wasn&#x27;t doing anyone favors by spreading apple seeds everywhere because the trees would produce mostly inedible apples.<p>1. <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Apple#Breeding"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Apple#Breeding</a><p>2. <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencelearn.org.nz&#x2F;resources&#x2F;844-breeding-a-new-apple-cultivar"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencelearn.org.nz&#x2F;resources&#x2F;844-breeding-a-new...</a>",russellbeattie,2024-11-30 19:43:09

"This article makes me want to get a DNA test. In my family, it’s very common to sleep in the six-hour range. I personally sleep from 10 pm to 4:25 am every day, often waking up around 4:15 am before my watch vibrates to wake me.<p>If I sleep eight hours, I feel groggy, jet-lagged, and generally have a day where I’m slogging through molasses to get from one task to the next.<p>My wife has raised concerns about my sleep pattern, so I started using sleep-tracking tools like Fitbit and, more recently, an Apple Watch. She tracks her sleep too, and the big difference we’ve noticed is that I fall asleep within about two minutes, and my “sleep efficiency” using these tools is 98%. If I’m traveling and feel a bit jet-lagged, I can take a 20-minute nap (often without an alarm) and wake up feeling refreshed. She also seems to wake up a lot, most nights I &quot;sleep like a log&quot; and I only wakeup in the morning.<p>My mother has the same pattern but stays up later and sleeps about six hours into the morning. I used to do this too, but around age 23, I switched to an earlier bedtime and a consistent daily routine. When I became a “morning person,” I found I could code like crazy in the morning before “starting” my day, and this rewarding experience reinforced the habit.<p>I’ve tested this pattern in many ways, including not using an alarm (I still wake up around the same time for weeks at a time) and using a “light clock” I built with a Raspberry Pi to slowly brighten the room. Again, I wake up after roughly 6 hours and 20 minutes. Now, I use my Apple Watch to vibrate as a gentle reminder to start the day. On weekends, I keep the same schedule and use the extra time to read or hack away at side projects, often coding until the late afternoon when my wife protests enough that I need to stop and hang out or do my honey-do&#x27;s.<p>About 10 years ago, during my annual checkup, my wife asked my doctor about this sleep pattern. The doctor asked me several questions, seemingly looking for signs of sleep deficit or dysfunction. In the end, he said I could do a sleep study but concluded, “If it works, don’t break it.”<p>As for productivity, I’ve found I can code effectively from 4:30 am to 8:30 am, then shower and work from 9 am to 6 pm without much trouble. I also practice intermittent fasting, typically eating only at 6 pm, with a protein shake around noon. This habit happened by accident—I realized breakfast slowed me down, and eating lots of carbs impaired my cognitive function and ability to code or handle complex tasks in the morning.<p>Before you ask, I generally don’t use caffeine or other stimulants. Occasionally, I’ll have one cup of coffee around 9 am as a social habit, but I recently stopped that again and actually feel better.

"One unique and new feature of Slang that sets it apart from existing shading languages is support for differentiation and gradient computation&#x2F;propagation - while still cross-compiling generated forward and backward passes to other, platform-specific shading languages.
Before, the only way to backpropagate through shader code (such as material BRDF or lighting computation) was to either manually differentiate every function and chain them together, or rewrite it in another language or framework - such as PyTorch or a specialized language&#x2F;framework like as Dr.Jit, and keeping both versions in sync after any changes.

"Tell that to Synapse customers. Many millions of dollars are missing.<p>Banks have to follow strict rules to account for where all the money goes. But the way fintechs work, they usually just have one or a couple underlying &quot;FBO&quot; accounts where all the pooled money is held, but then the fintech builds a ledger on top of this (and, as the article points out, to varying levels of engineering competence) to track each individual customer&#x27;s balance within this big pool of money. In Synapse&#x27;s case, their ledger said the total amount of all of their individual customer balances ended up being much more than the actual funds held in the underlying FBO accounts. Lots of folks are assuming fraud but I&#x27;m willing to put money that it was just a shitty, buggy ledger.<p>FWIW, after seeing &quot;how the sausage is made&quot;, I would never put money into a fintech depository account.

"One of the things it took a little time to wrap my head around when I started working at Google was trading off reliability or correctness for scaling.<p>I had previously built things like billing systems and small-scale OLTP web applications, where the concept of even asking the question of whether there could be any acceptable data loss or a nonzero error rate hadn&#x27;t occurred to me. It was eye-opening to see, not so much that if you&#x27;re doing millions of qps, some are going to fail, but more the difference in engineering attitude. Right this instant, there are probably thousands of people who opened their Gmail and it didn&#x27;t load right or gave them a 500 error. Nobody is chasing down why that happened, because those users will just hit reload and go on with their day. Or from another perspective, if your storage has an impressive 99.99999% durability over a year, when you have two billion customers, 200 people had a really miserable day.<p>It was a jarring transition from investigating every error in the logs to getting used to everything being a little bit broken all the time and always considering the cost before trying to do something about it.",masto,2024-11-29 23:52:03

"Pardon me an old story... I never built a double entry accounting system but decades ago I did build a billing system for a internet&#x2F;telcom startup that grew to a modest 8 figures revenue.<p>By accident and not knowing any better as a young dev, I ended up building the billing logic from day one, and for better and worse building it in two places in the system (on a consumer-facing billing webpage, and on a separate backed process that generated invoices and charged credit cards.)<p>It turned out to be remarkably hard to keep them in sync.  We were constantly iterating trying to get traction as we burned down our capital, releasing new products and services, new ways of discounting and pricing (per use, per month, first X free, etc), features like masterpayer&#x2F;subaccounts for corporate accounts, user-assignable cost centers, tax allocation to those cost centers with penny allocation, etc such that new wrinkles and corner cases would keep popping up causing the numbers on my two screens&#x2F;methods not to match.<p>Being personally responsible for the billing, I would go over all the invoices by hand for a couple days each month to insure they matched before we charged the credit cards and mailed out printed invoices as a final check to prevent mistakes. There was always&#x2F;often some new problem I&#x27;d find affecting one or a small handful of customers which I would then fix the code before we billed. I never felt good letting go and not doublechecking everything by hand.<p>I thought about refactoring the billing logic to occur in one place to eliminate these mismatches and my manual crosschecking, but after a lot of thought I realized I wasn&#x27;t comfortable with a single codebase and liked having two codebases as it helped me catch my own errors. I then just made it easier and easier to run automate and crosschecks between the two.  The billing code was a little too gnarly to be proud of, but I was very proud of the outcome in how accurate our billing was, the lack of complaints and many near misses we avoided for many years. I do feel twinges of guilt for the complexity I left my successors but I still don&#x27;t really regret it.<p>After that experience, the motivation for double entry bookkeeping has always made a lot of sense to me.

"It&#x27;s just like it was with pen and paper...

"Learning and using the ledger-cli accounting tool taught me a lot about this. It&#x27;s incredible how messy seemingly simple things can be and how much trouble a bunch of cents can cause. Seems to be the accounting version of off-by-one errors. It is very tempting to just write them off as losses and forget about them forever.<p>Rounding in particular is a truly endless source of trouble and has caused me to chase after a lot of cents. Dividing up a large payment into multiple installments is the major cause of rounding in my use case. Life starts to suck the second things fail to be evenly divisible. I created an account to track gains and losses due to rounding and over time and it&#x27;s adding up to quite the chunk of change.<p>Hilariously, the payment systems would charge me incorrect rounded up amounts and then they would refund the difference to my credit card at some undefined time in the future. Tracking and correlating all these seemingly random one or two cent transactions has got to be one of the most annoying activities I&#x27;ve ever learned to put up with. Not only do I have to figure out why things aren&#x27;t quite adding up, I have to patch things up in the future when they fix the mistake.<p>Why can&#x27;t these things just charge the correct amounts? For example, imagine splitting up $55.53 into four installments. That&#x27;s 4x$13.8825. They could charge me 3x$13.88 + 1x$14.89. Instead they round it up to $55.56 and charge me 4x$13.89, then maybe they refund me $0.03 some unknown day in the future. It&#x27;s like the systems go out of their way to be as annoying as possible. Some systems do this silly single cent refund dance in my credit card statement even though they print the exact same 3xN + 1xN+0.01 solution in the receipt. Makes absolutely no sense to me.<p>It&#x27;s getting to the point I&#x27;m trying to avoid this nonsense by structuring purchases so the final price is evenly divisible by some common factors. I never liked the .99 cents manipulation trick but I seriously hate it now.",matheusmoreira,2024-11-30 21:49:06
"The blockchain industry is basically founded on incompetence. If you go back to early Silk Road and Mtgox you can see some shocking things. Like the founders were posting questions on Stackoverflow about database basics. They then ended up building systems with race conditions (withdrawal code for both systems.)<p>See, if you&#x27;re an engineer (from a web background) you might think that using a regular backend language with a relational DB would be fine. But this service is typically optimized for concurrency. That might sound amazing. But what you really want is a simple queue. This ensures everything is applied in order and makes it impossible to accidentally have transactions execute on stale state. Plus, a queue can be executed amazingly fast -- we&#x27;re talking Nasdaq scales. If you use a standard DB you&#x27;ll end up doing many horrible broken hacks to simulate what would be trivial engineering had you used the right design from the start.<p>You&#x27;ve got other things to worry about, too. Financial code needs to use integer math for everything. Floating point and &#x27;decimals&#x27; lead to unexpected results. The biggest complexity with running large-scale blockchain services is having to protect &#x27;hot wallets.&#x27; Whenever an exchange or payment system is hacked the target is always the funds that sit on the server. When the industry began there were still many ways to protect the security of these hot wallets. The trouble is: it required effort to implement and these protocols weren&#x27;t widely known. So you would get drive-by exchanges that handled millions of dollars with private keys sitting on servers ready to be stolen...<p>Today there are many improvements for security. New cryptographic constructs like threshold ECDSA, hardware wallets, hardware key management (like enclaves), smart contract systems (decentralized secret sharing... and even multi-sig can go a long way), and designs that are made to be decentralized that remove the need for a centralized deposit system (still needs some level of centralization when trading to a stable coin but its better than nothing.)<p>I would say the era where people &#x27;build&#x27; ledgers though is kind of over. To me it appears that we&#x27;re organizing around a super-node structure where all the large &#x27;apps&#x27; handle their own changes off-chain (or alternatively based on regular trust.) The bottom layer will still support payments but it will be used less often. With more transaction activity happening on layers above. I think its still important to scale the chain and make it as secure as possible. Bitcoin has a unique focus here on security above everything else. Making it ideal for long-term hedges. For every day stuff I can&#x27;t think of any chains that have more credible R &amp; D than Ethereum.

"I own a Guangzhou Sanjing R5-8K-S2 inverter that had issues shortly after installation where it was generating far less power than expected.<p>The web telemetry panel had multiple gaps throughout the day where energy generation dropped to 0, but having datapoints logged every 10 minutes didn&#x27;t give out enough information to determine why that was happening.<p>It also had a current status endpoint which updated every 10 seconds. I wrote a python script to log those updates into a file, and eventually discovered the inverter was shutting down itself and waiting 5 minutes every time it found its grid voltage to be greater than 241V.<p>Installer wanted utility to lower the house&#x27;s grid transformer tap, but needed authorization from Utility, who declined claiming it was already on the lowest tap possible. Cynically, i think they declined because lowering further would lower grid voltage at night below minimums they&#x27;re contractually required to maintain.<p>Tried going into the manufacturer&#x27;s website to see if a firmware update could solve this. Couldn&#x27;t find firmware updates, but i did find a manual for their local monitoring app, including a password for installer-only settings, set to &quot;123456&quot;.<p>The app doesn&#x27;t include any functionality to change said password to something else, so i assume it&#x27;s hardcoded. There was one change i could still legally do without violating anything - raising the grid shutdown threshold voltage from 241 to 242V. This change did get reflected in subsequent logs, so the settings panel is functional. I could technically increase that further (to a maximum of 275V), but that would expose me to liability.<p>Parents suggest contacting the inverter&#x27;s distributor for support, and they asked for a password i was never given. Apparently the manufacturer is suppopsed to create accounts for installers&#x2F;distributors buying directly from them, and i somehow bypassed that process when creating an account for myself, without even realizing it.<p>Some more clarification later, it turns out they can still remotely access the inverter with its serial number. After doing so, they &quot;fixed&quot; the issue without explaining how. Checking the installer settings interface, it turns out they just increased the grid overvoltage shutdown threshold to 275V right off the bat.<p>At least i got them on record saying they did that, so i&#x27;m technically in the clear. Still, having that kind of access was scary enough to want to make me disconnect the inverter from the internet.<p>Turns out its warranty (which only expires in 2036) has terms requiring it to stay connected to the internet. That&#x27;s enough time to trigger WW3 and a resulting horus scenario (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;horusscenario.com&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;horusscenario.com&#x2F;</a>).<p>Until then, the best i can do is to throttle the inverter&#x27;s internet connection to something like 10kbps, which isn&#x27;t enough to prevent someone persistent enough from uploading new firmware.<p>Stories like this make me reconsider keeping it connected. I&#x27;m surprised we haven&#x27;t seen inverter ransomware yet.",RA2lover,2024-11-30 23:08:23
