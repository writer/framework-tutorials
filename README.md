## What is Framework?

Writer Framework is an open-source framework for creating AI applications. Build user interfaces using a visual editor; write the backend code in Python.

Writer Framework is fast and flexible with a clean, easily-testable syntax. It provides separation of concerns between UI and business logic, enabling more complex applications.

## Installation and Quickstart

Getting started with Writer Framework is easy. It works on Linux, Mac and Windows.

```sh
pip install writer

We recommend using a virtual environment.
