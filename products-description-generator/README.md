## Usage

1. Upload one of the data sample from the data folder of the app. Alternatively, you can upload your own data once the column names are the same as those in the sample file.
2. Generate PDPs will iterate through the data set and rewrite the long description and combine and format the features and specification fields.
3. The output is provided in downloadable HTML and Excel spreadsheets.
4. There are three languages currently configured for translation: Spanish, French and Hindi. Once the translation button is clicked the app will translate the excel spreadsheet to all three.
