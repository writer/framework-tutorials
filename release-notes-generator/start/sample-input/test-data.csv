"We need to review, formalize, and document security event structure.
 

 ### Phase I
 - [x] Document all fields and create documents describing all log fields:
  - [x] Access Log
  - [x] WAF Security Event
  - [x] Service Policy
  - [x] Bot Defense Security Event
 - [x] Delete irrelevant fields (not relevant to customers, not used internally)
 - [x] Hide fields irrelevant to customers (move to `internal_info` to make them invisible to customers).
 

 ### Phase II
 - [ ] Hide irrelevant fields in Lightning
 - [ ] Hide irrelevant fields in Global Log Receiver.
 - [x] Create a document for the ""API access log"", describing all log fields.
 - [x] Rename the misleading field `calculated_action` to `recommended_action`
 

 **Note:**
 Some attributes have been added during the chain, should get from @user1 the components chain to validate from where to delete each attribute.

 #### Release Notes Info
  Release-Note-Summary: Introducing Detailed Events in the Synthetic Monitoring Service.
 

  Release-Note-Detail: Users can triage issues faster and dive deeper into critical events with `Detailed Events` in synthetic HTTP and DNS monitors in the `Events` table. 
 

 

 #### TOI/Wiki

 ## Description
 Synthetic monitoring customers want the ability to the view the verbose output/response of the synthetic monitor checks they are running against their endpoints to understand what issues and outages their end users are facing when using their applications.
 

 This would be a minor enhancement to the existing events design that exists in the service today.
